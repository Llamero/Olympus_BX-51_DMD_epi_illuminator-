## <center>Olympus BX-51 DMD epi-illuminator modification</center>

The following CAD files show two designs for installing a DMD image projector in the epi illumination path of an Olympus BX-51 microscope.  This allows for projecting high resolution images through the objective onto the sample plane.  

To access the CAD files, download both component files, and then concatenate and unzip them using 7zip: https://www.7-zip.org/

The CAD files can then be viewed using FreeCAD: https://www.freecadweb.org/



All parts are listed by their part number, with most parts being from Thorlabs, and parts prefixed with “EO” are from Edmund Optics.

To build the systems, simply remove the current optics in the BX-51 arm, and then install the optics listed in the CAD files.  You can use the “Measure” tool in FreeCAD to ensure the parts are placed in the correct positions.
